## Glossary

* **Branch**- Parallel version of a respository that lets you work freely without changing anything on the main repository.

* **Clone** - When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub to your local machine. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project.
* **Commit** - This is an action that acts like a snapshot of the repository. It is a snapshot of your entire repository at a specific time. 
* **Fetch** - This command downloads commits, files and refs from a remote repository to local working branch without commiting allowing you to review the changes before committing. 
* **GIT** - most commonly used control system, GIT tracks that changes you make to files, so you have a record of what had been done and you can revert to specific versions if ever needed. 
* **Github** - Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on project from anywhere. 
* **Merge** - This command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
* **Merge Conflict** - Merge conflict arises when two separate branches have made edits to the same line in a file, or when a file has been deleted in one branch but edited in the other. Conflicts will most likely happen when working in a team environment.
* **Push** - This command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. This is how commits are transferred from local to remote repository. 
* **Pull** - Pull command lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
* **Remote** -  is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server.
* **Repository** - A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

##Github Tutorial

<h2> Part 2 </h2> 
* - Step 1 : Make sure the correct version of Webstorm. For Github make sure an account is created. 
*
* - Step 2 : Webstorm is going to be the primary editor for the ReadMe files. 

* - Step 3 : Log in to the Github website once an account is created, create a new repository. 

* - Step 4 : Name the repository to however you like it to be named. 

* - step 5 : Wrtie a small description about what the main purpose of the repository will be like a title.
 
* - Step 6 : Then initialize it with a README file. 

* - Step 7 : Next step would be to open the repository in Webstorm. 

* - Step 8 : Make sure README file is selected and open that file. 

* - Step 9 : Once it is opened, open the README file and you can begin typing what you need to do next. 

* - Step 10 : Once all your work is typed and done working in the file make sure all the work is saved and you can also turn on the autosave button. 

* - Step 11 : Then the next step is to publish the repository in Github. 

* - Step 12 : Once that is done, commit the changes and open the Github website and merge with the main branch.
